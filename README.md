This repository presents my MATLAB work on generating smooth trajectories for motion systems using both Polynomial and B-Spline interpolation techniques.
The aim of this project was to achieve continuous position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk profiles — ensuring smooth and efficient motion paths for dynamic systems.

This project was developed during my Research Internship at NIT Bhopal (June–July 2025) under the guidance of Dr. C. M. Krishna,
Head of the Centre of Excellence in Product Design and Smart Manufacturing
